# current state

## GitHub browser bridge failure handling

- `capture.yml` persists every result in `browser-result.json` and exposes `status` / `qa_passed` outputs.
- Browser capacity, HTTP 429, and temporary gateway 502/503/504 states are deferred, with QA explicitly blocked/unverified. A successful dispatch job alone does not prove QA passed.
- Retry metadata and deterministic fallback hints are preserved; no capacity retry occurs before reset and no automatic fallback claims session equivalence.
- Snapshot/screenshot gateway failures get at most one bounded retry when Retry-After is ten seconds or less. Session mutations and uncertain transport outcomes are never automatically replayed.
- Authentication, malformed responses, RPC/tool errors, and failed QA results remain failures.

## Gen 2.1

- evidence controller chooses the cheapest capable engine deterministically
- deterministic recipes use GitHub Chromium; Browser Run is reserved for exploratory/session work
- Browser Run 429s are first-class deferred capacity states with retry metadata and GitHub Chromium fallback
- authenticated external evidence ingest writes GitHub Chromium screenshots into the same private R2 contract
- evidence runs have lifecycle state and grouped step metadata
- `evidence.yml` executes one Chromium browser per suite
- `field.stage0` currently captures Canvas first paint, Full, Focus, and Float against `/qa/work/{projectId}`
- `/builder/noauth` remains smoke-only and is not used by real-project evidence runs


## Gen 2 Wave 1

- Browser Run foundation: implemented on the Gen 2 branch
- Browser binding: `BROWSER`
- evidence store: private R2 bucket `loew-inspector-evidence`
- browser tools: `browser_screenshot`, `browser_snapshot`
- normal Chat compatibility workflow: `capture.yml`
- HTTP inspector remains unchanged as a separate diagnostic path
- Quick Actions limitation is explicit: console errors and failed-request traces are not fabricated
- interactive session tools: browser_open, browser_interact, browser_capture, browser_close
- session state is Browser Run + private R2 metadata, never Worker process memory
- interaction vocabulary is bounded; arbitrary JavaScript is not exposed
- cross-call console/network event history remains marked unsupported because Browser Run does not replay prior CDP event streams to a newly connected client

## verified

- deployed inspector gateway: `https://inspector.loew.fi/mcp`
- gateway version deployed: `0.3.1`
- public health route works
- Cloudflare Managed OAuth is configured
- Cloudflare service-token authentication works locally
- downstream auth model is linked-app token forwarding
- `fetch_loew_url` is read-only and bounded to loew.fi HTTPS targets
- GitHub Actions run [36296247963](https://github.com/lrnolivia/loew-inspector/actions/runs/36296247963) succeeded with inspector HTTP 200 and a `LOEW_INSPECTOR_RESULT` showing target HTTP 200, JSON, and a runner API body
- A [normal ChatGPT conversation](https://chatgpt.com/c/6ab8a4b4-a6ac-83ea-8926-2c52fb6d36e3) used its connected Composio GitHub action to dispatch [run 36296334657](https://github.com/lrnolivia/loew-inspector/actions/runs/36296334657), read the log, and report target HTTP 200, JSON, and a runner worker object in the body. This is direct evidence on the normal-chat surface, rather than Codex-only reachability.

## compatibility bridge

`.github/workflows/inspect.yml` exists solely to let normal ChatGPT reach the canonical inspector through Composio -> GitHub Actions. It calls the Access-protected `workers.dev` hostname of the same deployed Worker, using the `loew-inspector-github-bridge` service token.

Cloudflare Access app `e03969b6-ecb4-40d5-b66d-c11ac91ce7a1` protects the workers.dev hostname. Its Service Auth policy `aea892bf-12c7-4b8a-85bd-87568aa17350` allows that token. Linked-app policy `eb0289df-8d22-4b09-aa21-3a656bd80fff` permits the authenticated inspector to read protected loew.fi targets. No broad Access bypass was added.

Ray `a417e7cabccd2546` on `/mcp` was a Bot Fight Mode managed challenge. After moving ingress to workers.dev, the same zone feature challenged the downstream runner request. Cloudflare Free-plan Bot Fight Mode has no path-specific skip, so it was turned off zone-wide. Browser Integrity Check, Security Level Medium, managed rules, and Access are still enabled.

It does not replace MCP.

## QA decision

Preview remains runtime truth.

Inspector QA is external verification only. Add checks only where they provide evidence Preview cannot provide by itself, such as Access reachability, status/final URL, origin-vs-Access failure classification, content markers, or later DOM/screenshot parity evidence.
