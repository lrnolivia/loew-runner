# runner — current state

Updated: 2026-09-30. Baseline inspected: `1fec12ce7b7271afc3eeeb9fd8b73368a25f61db`.

## Verified implementation

- Release/package: 0.6.0; hosted UI is worker-first with Visual evidence.
- `src/server.mjs` is the local adapter; `src/cloudflare-worker.mjs` is the hosted adapter. Hosted settings and Visual API are not implemented in the local adapter.
- Runner 3.0 exists as approved spec and assignment, not deployed product.
- Field reorganization is a separate assignment. Current `field/` branch enforcement remains until compatibility is proved.
- Runner/Inspector infrastructure work is protected. The 3.0 worker owns dashboard/data-model integration, not provider scheduling or capacity policy.
- No first-class Team registry exists yet. Historical reports do not prove current chat liveness.

## Access/control migration snapshot

Verified 2026-09-30:

- `relay` plugin is at v0.4.1 with the Relay Loop mark packaged as `assets/relay.png` for both `composerIcon` and `logo`. The immutable backend/package name remains `relay-github`; the human-facing product name is `relay`.
- Canonical OAuth/MCP ingress is `https://relay.loew.fi/mcp`. Cloudflare Managed OAuth discovery and ChatGPT authentication are verified. A post-auth inspector tool invocation through the new canonical hostname is still required before retiring the old inspector MCP path.
- `relay.loew.fi`, `relay-inspector.loew.fi`, and `inspector.loew.fi` currently route to the same `loew-inspector-gateway` Worker. The latter two are compatibility/legacy hostnames, not the target product identity.
- Access app `relay` keeps `Only Me` and Managed OAuth/DCR. It currently also retains `relay-inspector.loew.fi` as a compatibility destination.
- Access app `loew.fi private` protects `loew.fi` and `*.loew.fi`. During migration it intentionally carries both new relay trust and old inspector/service-token trust. Do not delete old trust until authenticated relay access is proven against downstream protected resources and Access traffic shows the legacy path is idle.
- `field-qa` remains the working public/bypass boundary for field QA routes. External probes after removing `field-access` still showed the field root protected while `/builder/noauth`, `canvas.field.loew.fi`, and `preview.field.loew.fi` remained publicly reachable as intended.
- Redundant Runner Access apps `runner-access`, `loew-runner`, and `loew-runner - Cloudflare Workers` were removed after the broad private boundary was verified and the Runner-specific apps showed no recent Access traffic.
- Redundant `field-access` was removed after the broad private boundary plus `field-qa` behavior was re-probed successfully.
- Legacy `loew-inspector-mcp` and `loew-inspector GitHub transport` remain on purpose. The GitHub transport still had substantial recent traffic and is a live fallback.
- Several reusable policies with zero app references remain cleanup candidates; they should be removed only after another reference-count check.
- Observed caveat: `https://relay.loew.fi/health` still redirects through the broad `loew.fi private` boundary even though the relay app carries a public `/health` override. Do not assume a public override on one overlapping Access app bypasses a separate wildcard app.

Detailed IDs, rollback data, and the migration checklist are in `docs/ACCESS_CONTROL.md`.

## Baseline repository cleanup ledger

Inventory observed 2026-09-29 from fetched remote refs and GitHub's complete open-PR page (one PR). Counts below are Git ancestry, not semantic equivalence. No branches or PRs have been deleted/closed.

| Remote branch | Ahead / behind main | Unique work | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `main` | 0 / 0 | authoritative baseline | KEEP — integration truth |
| `control` | 0 / 57 | none by ancestry; old bootstrap tree | KEEP PROTECTED — designated future mutable control branch; not a stale task branch |
| `shared-repair-reconciler` | 2 / 29 | `d7189f4`, `cce07e9`; workflow, reconciler, tests, contract/project metadata | KEEP ACTIVE — open PR #4; infrastructure ownership; do not transplant or close from UI scope |
| `status/field-runner-authority-20260929` | 1 / 8 | `4d8020b`; single field authority report | QUARANTINE/REVIEW — preserve provenance, inspect source authority before transplant/archive |

Open PR #4: **Automate field shared repair reconciliation**, head `cce07e91e089d040c35db48fecd69cdc841a4028`. A historical red check alone does not condemn this branch. Its infrastructure owner must handle promotion.

Temporary local build checkpoints are separate from this remote baseline. `runner/3-a-control-plane` preserves early unshipped modules; baseline reconciliation precedes their integration.

## Documentation cleanup

- README's mixed 0.1 pilot instructions, planned deployment and dependency snapshots are superseded as the entry point; exact original preserved at `docs/archive/README-0.6-baseline.md`.
- This file owns current verified state and the cleanup ledger. README routes; architecture owns durable structure; 3.0 spec owns approved intent.
- Existing `reports/` are provenance, not canonical implementation state or Team registration. They remain intact until structured supersession/reference proof exists.
- Universal Bible/current authority and Night Shift contracts remain authoritative and unchanged.
- No speculative first-class worker identities have been created.

## Next gates

1. Finish baseline reconciliation and verify checks on its exact PR head.
2. 3.0-A: project/assignment/Team read surfaces, deterministic overlap and attention, live branch/PR inventory, notes inventory. Preserve Visual/automation controls.
3. 3.0-B: guarded writes and cleanup proof with audit events. Use optimistic concurrency; no direct target main writes.
4. 3.0-C: structured consolidation and deterministic handoffs; prose conflicts remain reviewable.
5. 3.0-D: consume existing infrastructure records; show unknown when capacity has no authoritative measurement.
6. 3.0-E: runtime/accessibility verification and final replacement cleanup. Version 3.0 only after release acceptance.
